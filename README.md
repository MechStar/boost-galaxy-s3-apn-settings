boostApnBackup
==============

If you flashed your Boost Mobile phone with a Sprint ROM, this XML contains Boost APN settings, which will help you reconfigure mobile data as it is a little different from Sprint. This file was generated by APN Manager Pro app using an out-of-the-box Samsung Galaxy S3 (SPH-L710) phone. Good luck!
